app_pile_design.py - Entry Point for Streamlit Deployment
=========================================================

This file serves as the main entry point for Streamlit Cloud deployment.
It redirects to the current version (v2.1) of the pile design application.

For local development, you can run either:
- streamlit run app_pile_design.py (uses this file)
- streamlit run app_pile_design_v2_1.py (runs v2.1 directly)

# Import and run the current version (v2.1)
from app_pile_design_v2_1 import *

# Note: Streamlit will automatically execute the imported module
# No additional code needed here as all the app logic is in app_pile_design_v2_1.py
